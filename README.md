# NLP Techniques Project

## Overview
This repository contains **hands-on implementations of key Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques**. The project demonstrates different approaches for **text representation, semantic understanding, and linguistic analysis**.

## Project Notebooks
1. **Text Representation Techniques** (`Text_Representation.ipynb`)  
   - Covers TF-IDF, Bag-of-Words, and N-gram feature extraction  
   - Demonstrates how to convert raw text into machine-readable features for ML models

2. **Word2Vec Implementation** (`Word2Vec_Implementation.ipynb`)  
   - Implements Word2Vec embeddings to capture semantic relationships between words  
   - Shows how distributed representations improve NLP model performance

3. **POS Tagging** (`POS_Tagging.ipynb`)  
   - Part-of-speech tagging using NLTK  
   - Helps analyze grammatical structure and word roles in sentences

## Key Insights
- Text representation is critical for building **effective NLP models**.  
- Word embeddings like Word2Vec capture **semantic meaning** beyond simple frequency-based methods.  
- POS tagging enhances **linguistic understanding**, useful for downstream tasks like parsing or named entity recognition.

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- NLTK
